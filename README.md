# CODESYS Profinet Integration

This repository contains code, configuration files, and documentation for integrating **Profinet** devices using **CODESYS**. It aims to simplify the process of setting up and using Profinet with CODESYS-based controllers, enabling seamless communication between devices and CODESYS projects.

## Features

- Integration with **Profinet** devices.
- Support for various Profinet communication functionalities.
- Easy-to-use configuration and setup.
- Example programs for common Profinet scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- **CODESYS** Development System installed on your machine. CODESYS V3.5 SP20 Patch 5 was used on a Windows 11 64-bit Arm VM running in with VMWare Fusion on a MacMini M2. 
- A raspberry pi (was using a pi 3)
- A **Profinet** compatible device. The SICK AG Profinet encoder ANS58B was used.
- Basic understanding of **Profinet** protocol and **CODESYS** programming environment.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started with the repository, first clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mobro/CodesysProfinet.git
